## Task 1 - Run the site

In order to run the website using the built in development server use the following steps:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Assuming the two commands above completed successfully you should see the starter webpage open up
in a browser.

## Task 2 - Modify and Debug

We are going to make a few small modifications to the starter code and then make sure we can use
the built in debugger for VSCode!

## Task 3 - Complete the Retrospective

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file **Retrospective.md** and complete each section
with a TODO comment. 

## Task 4 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all your code to GitHub for
grading!
